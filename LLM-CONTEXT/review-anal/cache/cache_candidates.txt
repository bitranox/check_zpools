POTENTIAL CACHING CANDIDATES
================================================================================

_get_property_value:
  location: zfs_parser.py:336
  current_status: No caching
  call_pattern: Called repeatedly for "health", "capacity", "size", "allocated", "free"
  recommendation: Could cache with @lru_cache(maxsize=16) on a per-parser basis
  expected_benefit: Low - function is very simple (dict lookups)
  priority: LOW

_extract_capacity_metrics:
  location: zfs_parser.py:622
  current_status: No caching
  call_pattern: Called once per pool per check
  recommendation: No caching - results vary per pool and check
  expected_benefit: None - not a pure function (results change)
  priority: N/A

_build_monitor_config:
  location: behaviors.py:354
  current_status: No caching
  call_pattern: Called 1-2 times per application run
  recommendation: No caching - called infrequently
  expected_benefit: None - infrequent calls
  priority: N/A

json_loads_in_zfs_client:
  location: zfs_client.py:412
  current_status: No caching
  call_pattern: Called every time pool data is fetched
  recommendation: No caching - data changes on every call
  expected_benefit: None - not repeatable data
  priority: N/A
